His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life. in his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature. Bees, For example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk.

Darwin was only too aware of the storm his theory of evolution would provoke but he would surely have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy still raging a century and a half later. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists and indeed theologians, yet millions of people continue to question its veracity. in The Greatest Show on Earth Richard Dawkins takes on creationists, including followers of ‘Intelligent Design’ and all those who question the fact of evolution through natural selection. like a detective arriving on the scene of a crime, he sifts through fascinating layers of scientific facts and disciplines to build a CAST-iron CASE: from the living examples of natural selection in birds and insects; the ‘TIME clocks’ of trees and radioactive dating that calibrate a timescale For evolution; the fossil record and the traces of our earliest ancestors; to confirmation from molecular biology and genetics. all of this, and much MorE, bears witness to the truth of evolution. The Greatest Show on Earth comes at a critical TIME: systematic opposition to the fact of evolution is now flourishing as never before, especially in America. In Britain and elsewhere in the world, teachers witness insidious attempts to undermine the status of science in their classrooms.

Lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America.

The fortunes of the Rostovs and the Bolkonskys, of Pierre, Natasha, and Andrei, are intimately connected with the national history that is played out in parallel with their lives. Balls and soirees alternate with councils of war and the machinations of statesmen and generals, scenes of violent battles with everyday human passions in a work whose extraordinary imaginative power has never been surpassed. The prodigious cast of characters, both great and small, seem to act and move as if connected by threads of destiny as the novel relentlessly questions ideas of free will, fate, and providence. Yet Tolstoy\'s portrayal of marital relations and scenes of domesticity is as truthful and poignant as the grand themes that underlie them.
